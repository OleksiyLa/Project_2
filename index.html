        <li>To initiate a game, press the "Start Game" button located at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>A sequence of cards will be revealed for a brief period.</li>
        <li>You need to memorize those cards and choose them when they close.</li>
        <li>You must select them in the correct order, starting from one.</li>
        <li>When you successfully select all the correct cards, you will level up. You will receive an additional try and advance one level.</li>
        <li>To progress to the next level, you need to wait for the timer displayed on the board to run out, or you can press the "Continue" button on the board.</li>
        <li>You can pause before the new level starts by either refreshing the page to stop the timer or by closing the tab with the game.</li>
        <li>The maximum level you can reach is level 20, which is the most challenging. As the levels increase, the number of cards you need to remember also increases.</li>
