# Memory Game
A memory game introduces a distinct challenge by tasking players with memorizing the placements of hidden cards. At the outset, the cards are briefly exposed before being concealed once again. Players must rely on their memory to unveil the cards in the accurate numerical order. Victory in this game is achieved by successfully progressing through all 20 levels.
